I believe people on teams build each other up and to that end I aim to provide the best I can to my teammates with help on tasks as well as motivation.

My time as a Gameplay Engineer at SIE Santa Monica Studio gave me a chance to listen to the creativity of the folks there in approaching problems and to do some creative thinking of my own. I got to delve into a sophisticated combat system and I really liked that. My experience at 343 Industries has made me better at iterating on features and collaborating with designers and artists, especially due to the waypoints system. At both of these studios I always tried to learn as much as I could from experienced engineers & designers, and through my own time with the codebase.
