The salary calculation is based on a few things - 
I have a loan to repay. The salary amount takes my expenses and the loan repayment into account.
I ensure diligent work. I schedule and track my work well which helps working with producers. I have used Azure DevOps a lot.
I have experience with workflow support to help designers and artists with workflow issue resolution and escalation. I am good at talking to them.
I can take ownership of a system or feature that I develop.
I have learned from game industry veterans in my Masters degree in Game Engineering. That has given me exposure to industry-level knowledge and know-how.
I provide feedback to the design team through playtests. I have learned game design in my Masters degree and continue to, which helps with that.
I have put these skills and qualities into practice in my previous work experience.
